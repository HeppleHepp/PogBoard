## PogBoard

Developement of telemetry and data collection using a microcontroller \(Arduino, ESP32 etc\) to output a PWM signal to a speed controller such as the 4QD porter 5/10.

In this repository you will find incremental developement to find the best solution to operating and using 24V DC batteries and motor as found on the Greenpower 
\(www.greenpower.co.uk\) regulations page. Electronics \(Pog Board\) and the software is free of licence, however, the board will be made available to purchase directly 
from me as a private agreement.
